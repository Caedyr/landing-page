# landing-page
The home page for a custom built website.

This is the second main assignment in the Odin Project's curriculum. For this task I was given only a design document for the layout to be based off of; All of the coding for HTML and CSS has been done independently, with no samples, starting points or snippets provided.

Although a color palette was provided as well, taking liberties and experimenting were encouraged. Thus instead of the modern steel palette I was given, I opted for lighter spring time colors, seeing as my mock website is entirely about goats.

I just think they're neat!
